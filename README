## 🎛️ Audio Setup (Crucial!)

To ensure audio goes to Discord without echo or stuttering, configure VoiceMeeter Banana exactly like this:

### In VoiceMeeter Banana:
1. Hardware Out A1 (Top Right Corner): Select your main Headphones (prefer WDM drivers).
2. Hardware Input 1 (Your Microphone):
   - Enable only **B1** (Sends your voice to Discord).
   - Disable **A1** (So you don't hear yourself).
3. Voicemeeter Input (Virtual - PC/Game Sounds):
   - Enable only **A1** (So you hear the game).
   - Disable **B1** (So game audio doesn't leak into the mic).
4. Voicemeeter AUX (Virtual - Where the Soundpad plays):
   - Enable **A1** (So you hear the sound effect).
   - Enable **B1** (So your friends hear the sound effect).

### In Windows:
- Click the sound icon and select as default output: **VoiceMeeter Input (VB-Audio VoiceMeeter VAIO)**.
- This ensures PC audio goes to the middle column of VoiceMeeter.

### ⚠️ Important (Anti-Robot Voice):
Ensure both VoiceMeeter and Windows are set to **48000Hz**.
- VoiceMeeter: Menu > System Settings > Preferred SampleRate: 48000Hz.
- Windows: Old Sound Panel (mmsys.cpl) > Recording/Playback > Properties > Advanced > 48000Hz.
